Methodology:
1. The query contour has no direction information. Consequently 'edge' (straight line approximation of trajectory curve acquired by sampling the
trajectory at points of significant tangential angle change which becomes nodes and the connecting straight line between two nodes is an edge) has
no independent direction.
