Each file xx.txt contains a N x 12 table, where N is the number of frames of this sequence. Row i represents the i'th pose of the left camera coordinate system (i.e., z pointing forwards) via a 3x4 transformation matrix. The matrices are stored in row aligned order (the first entries correspond to the first row), and take a point in the i'th coordinate system and project it into the first (=0th) coordinate system.
